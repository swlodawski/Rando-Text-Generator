Approach
In this approach, various methods and functions are utilized to achieve the desired functionalities, which are described below:

The structure of our web application is defined using HTML, where elements for paragraphs, sliders, dropdowns, and buttons are created.
JavaScript is employed to add interactivity to the application by handling user input, updating displayed values, and generating Lorem Ipsum text. 
Specific JavaScript functions perform tasks like real-time slider value updates, random word generation, and applying HTML tags.
To dynamically populate the HTML tag selection dropdown, a JavaScript function creates `<option>` elements based on an array of tag options. 
Additionally, event listeners are added to input elements (e.g., sliders, dropdowns) and the generate button to detect user interactions.
